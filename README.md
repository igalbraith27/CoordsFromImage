# Don-t-Trip--Itinerary-Planner
Calhacks 4.0 Back-End:  
Inside we have defined the way to get coordinates from an image using the encoded EXIF data. We also have provided a way that plots a path given different coordinates.  Finally we have defined an itinerary data. This entire project is coded in JavaScript.
